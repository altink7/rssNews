## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to instruct users on how to report a security vulnerability. Provide clear information on the reporting process and what users can expect.

1. **Reporting Security Vulnerabilities**: If you discover a security issue, please report it to our security team via email at [office@altin.at](mailto:office@altin.at). Please do not report security vulnerabilities as GitHub issues to prevent the public disclosure of sensitive information.

3. **Security Response Time**: Our security team will acknowledge your report within [7 business days]. They will assess the impact and severity of the issue and provide regular updates on the progress.

4. **Acceptance and Disclosure**: After the issue has been confirmed and a resolution is available, we will provide a timeline for when the vulnerability will be publicly disclosed. If the report is accepted, we will give credit to the reporter (if desired) for their responsible disclosure.

5. **Security Updates**: Security issues will be addressed in the latest supported versions. Users are encouraged to update to the latest version to receive security fixes.

6. **Out of Scope**: Please note that this security policy does not cover general software bugs or feature requests. Non-security-related issues should be reported on GitHub.

We take security seriously and appreciate your assistance in disclosing potential vulnerabilities responsibly.

Thank you for your contribution to the security of our project.
